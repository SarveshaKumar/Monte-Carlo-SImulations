HW_4_1_MC_Cost_Dist_Tri: This program uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate random tasks costs from a triangular distribution of staff hours and 
per staff costs.

HW_4_2_MC_CP: This program uses Monte Carlo simulation with the Longest Path CP Algorithm to obtain the distribution of of project duration times.

HW_4_3_MC_Short: This program does the following:

a. Accepts the upper and lower bounds for the costs of each link, the number of bins,
and the number of samples.
b. Note that the shortest path for each sample (since it may change from sample to
sample).
c. Provides the following output:

i. The MC mean cost, the associated standard deviation, the associated
standard error in the mean, the CRM, and the CPU time taken.

ii. The number of times the shortest path differed from the analyticalshortest
path (from HW 3.1).

iii. A histogram graph showing the distribution of project durations.

iv. A graph of the CRM.

HW_4_4_c_MC_AV_Wind_1_Run: This script produces random wind that affects the motion of an autonomous vehicle (AV) and plots the motion of the AV.

HW_4_4_e_MC_AV_Wind_Ns_Run: This script produces random wind that affects the motion of an autonomous vehicle (AV) and plots the motion of the AV. It runs the simulation Ns times to get statistics on expected behavior.

HW_4_5_MC_Ao_1_Elem_DE_Sim: This scritpt calculates how the mean Ao of a 1-Element System evolves over times using descrete-event MC simulation.It calculates the SD and SE for Ao and plots Ao(t).The inputs are the MTBCF and the MDT, and it assumes these have exponential distributions.
